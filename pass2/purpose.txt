Purpose of the Code

This code implements a Pass 2 Assembler for the SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) assembly language. Here's what it does:

Main Function
The program (pass2.c) is the second phase of a two-pass assembler that:

1. Resolves Symbol Addresses: Takes the intermediate output from Pass 1 and resolves all symbolic addresses using the symbol table

2. Generates Object Code: Converts assembly mnemonics into machine code by:
   - Looking up opcodes from the opcode table (Opcode.txt)
   - Resolving symbol references using the symbol table (Sym1.txt) 
   - Handling different data types (WORD, BYTE with character/hex constants)

3. Creates Loader Records: Generates standard object file format with:
   - H Record: Header record with program name, start address, and length
   - T Record: Text record containing the actual machine code
   - E Record: End record with execution start address

Input Files
- Out3.txt: Intermediate file from Pass 1 with location counters and assembly instructions
- Opcode.txt: Opcode table mapping mnemonics to machine codes  
- Sym1.txt: Symbol table with labels and their resolved addresses

Output
- Twoout.txt: Final assembled program with object code and loader records

Example Processing
The assembler converts assembly code like:
START 2000
LDA FIVE
STA ALPHA

Into object code with proper address resolution and generates loader records that can be loaded and executed by the SIC machine.

Summary: This is a complete implementation of the second pass of a two-pass assembler for educational purposes, demonstrating how assembly language is converted into executable machine code.
